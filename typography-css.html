<h1> Dani </h2>
<h2> The Way to rule World </h2>
<p class = "left">Tonight there was a big celebration for Jackson in Malibu with a bunch of people, fire works, they released doves and held beautiful speeches. Dan Bilzirian held a very moving and brave speech about how Jackaons death made him realize how litte real friends he had, and that most of his friends wouldn’t be his friends if it want for all his money… Jackson didn’t need money or to post pics of naked girls and guns, the whole world loved him anyway, and that made him realize that he wanted to change his way of living… </p>
