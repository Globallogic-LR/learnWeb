<h2>Type-casting</h2>

Type casting allows you to access a specific value as if it were of a different type

<script>
var n = 30;  
var m = 70;		
typeof n
"number"
var s = new String();
s = String(n) + String(m); //"3070"
s = Number(n) + Number(m); 100
var n = 50;
var b = Boolean(n);
b;		//true as it value is other from null or zero
var c = Boolean(n-50);
c;		//false as c is null 
Number (undefined); //NaN
Number ("5.6.7"); //NaN
</script>
